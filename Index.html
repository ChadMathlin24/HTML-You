Goals and Dreams: To be apart of the tech world, I may not know what I would like to be in the future but I'm in the path of doing something I enjoy.
</li>
<li>
 Mentors: I wish that Jonathan Chin and Yau Ho Fung were my mentors. My reason is that they take their time to explaining certain things that are new to me and I understand alot more when they talk about the topics.
